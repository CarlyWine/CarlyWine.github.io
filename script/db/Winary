Silky smooth long lasting finish. This is a wine that begs to be paired with a smoked meat. Think of that BBQ rib smothered in a smoky sauce.

Right out of the gate, I enjoy the earthy nose of this wine, and it opens up more with each glass.

Definitely cellar worthy.

If you get a chance to go to Yakima, please go to Gilbert. Charlie and Gloria Gilbert are some of the best people in the wine business.
